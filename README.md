=====
A user-friendly tool for simulating and visualizing stochastic models of hematopoiesis

## Description
We provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for simulating stochastic models of hematopoiesis. The tool is meant to be accessible to a wide audience, enabling visualization of model behavior as well as providing a platform for carrying out virtual experiments. 

## Use
The ready-for-use program `Simulator.jar` is available for download in this repository, and is designed with an intuitive interface. For more detailed instructions, a complete documentation is available in `manual.pdf`. 

The source code of the program, zipped in `Hemotopoiesis Project 2_20180429.rar`, is written in Java Programming Language and is available for download in this repository.

The R script `example_multiOutput.R` provides example code illustrating how one may analyze and plot statistics describing the output of batch simulations.
